# BTC_calculator

Note: This program was initially develope to calculte BTC price but I realized that you can use it for any criptocurrency you would like so.
In order to do that I change some parts of the code but in order to respect the original idea I decided to let the name "BTC calculator"
in honor of the initial criptocurrency that motivated me to carry out the project.

This code is headed to everybody who wants to invest in BTC and make fast calculations. 
How does it work? You must know the current variables for investing in any security such as:
1) The money you will invest.
2) BTC current price.
3) Dollar value: The program will ask you for this at the end to convert your dollars into Argentine pesos. 
4) Expected rentability from the operation. 

As result, the program will return:
1) The final amount of money. 
2) The expected profit and the price in dollars that BTC must reach to reach a specific rentability. 
3) A summary with the whole data. 

This program is especially headed to the people who are leaving in Argentina and using Argentina currency. 
Hope this program will make things easygoing at the time people are willing to invest. 

This program depreciates some details such as transaction costs because is thought to be used in a P2P environment with no commission costs.
